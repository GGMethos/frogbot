[[Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Red-M/frogbot.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Red-M/frogbot)
This is frog. frog is an irc bot written in python.
Based off work from lahwran's crow frog has some nice little extras that i added in to make life easy.
Some of frog's plugins like his ftp backup one will require some editing to get them to work
but i am made it easy for people to do that.
If you want to see frog in action join aperture.esper.net:6666 on irc then join his channel #frog on aperture.esper.net .

frog requires atleast Python 2.6 or above to run.
Frog also requires these modules/libraries for the version of pyhton you have:
- sqlite3  (included in the installation of python.(bastically you have python installed with no errors and you should have this!))
- lxml  (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml)

and these ones are optional but recommended:
- python 2.7 (not a module/library but you can only use BeautifulSoup on 2.7 and not 2.6 due to something with BeautifulSoup)
- beautiful soup  (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/BeautifulSoup/3.2.1)

all of the above plugins/modules/libraries can be obtained from http://pypi.python.org

i wish to give credit to these people/repos:
